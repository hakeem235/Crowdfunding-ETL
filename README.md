# Crowdfunding ETL

The goal of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that reads new data, performs transformations to clean and condense the data, and loads the data into existing tables. By taking code that was previously created, we refractored it into a function to make it more streamlined than before. Results of the data transformation can be seen in the database and screenshots in the Resources folder.
